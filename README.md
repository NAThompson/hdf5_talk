This talk is essentially an outline of my notes on "Python and HDF5".

To simply run the code,

$ git clone https://github.com/NAThompson/hdf5_talk.git
$ cd hdf5_talk
$ sudo /bin/bash
# docker run -it -v `pwd`:/hdf5_talk nathompson7/hdf5_talk /bin/bash


To build the docker image:

$ sudo /bin/bash
# cd hdf5_talk3
# docker build -t some_name .
